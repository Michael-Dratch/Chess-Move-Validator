Programming Assignment

Program Description:
The program takes a description of a chess board and selects a piece to move and prints in
the terminal a list of all of the valid moves that piece could take.

Example input argument:
"
WHITE: Rf1, Kg1, Pf2, Ph2, Pg3
BLACK: Kb8, Ne8, Pa7, Pb7, Pc7, Ra5
PIECE TO MOVE: Rf1
"

Example result:
LEGAL MOVES FOR Rf1: e1, d1, c1, b1, a1


Static Analysis:

For this project I used PMD and the Intellij static analysis tool to perform static
analysis after completing each component of the project. The results of this are provided
in a static analysis report provided in the project zip file.

Testing:

All tests are included in the test directory. Each class tests a different component
in the program and MainTest includes integration tests that test the entire program.
The tests use the junit testing framework and require junit to be installed.
The entire test suite can be run by right clicking the test directory in intellij
and clicking "Run 'All' Tests". If using a different IDE where you can not run the
entire directory, each file can be run independently to get all of the tests results.

Code Coverage:

I used the integrated Intellij Code Coverage Runner to see the line coverage and
branch coverage of my test suite. Here are the results:

line coverage: 99% (1014/1024)
branch coverage: 94% (568/598)

A screenshot of the more detailed report is provided in the project zip file and
shows line and branch coverage of each class.
